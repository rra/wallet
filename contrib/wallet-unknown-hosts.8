.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBwallet-unknown-hosts\fR constructs a database recording host-based keytabs
in wallet whose corresponding hosts are not found in \s-1DNS. \s0 It records in
that database the number of times the host wasn't found and the timestamp
of the first time it was not found.  It can then generate a report of
host-based keytab objects that have not been found for a minimum number of
consecutive times and which were last found longer ago than a particular
date.  Finally, it can purge from wallet all objects that meet those
requirements.
.PP
When run with the \f(CW\*(C`check\*(C'\fR argument, \fBwallet-unknown-hosts\fR traverses the
wallet database looking for host-based keytabs, which it recognizes by
looking for keytab objects for principals with at least one period (\f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR)
after a slash (\f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR).  It then applies a local check followed by a \s-1DNS\s0
check.  The \s-1DNS\s0 check is only successful (only considers the host to be
found) if it resolves to an \s-1IP\s0 address (possibly through a \s-1CNAME\s0).
.PP
For any host that's not found, it records that host in its associated
database.  If this is the first time it wasn't found, it records the first
missing time as the current time and the missing count as 1.  If it
previously wasn't found, it just increments the missing count.
.PP
For any host that is found, it deletes any record for that keytab from the
database.
.PP
When run with the \f(CW\*(C`report\*(C'\fR argument, \fBwallet-unknown-hosts\fR takes two
additional arguments: \fImin\fR and \fIdate\fR.  \fImin\fR is the minimum number of
times that a host must be found missing for the corresponding keytabs to
show up on the report.  \fIdate\fR is a cutoff date in seconds since epoch;
keytabs will not be included in the report unless their first missing date
is older than \fIdate\fR.  The output will be the name component of the
keytab objects in the wallet that correspond to unknown hosts and meet
those thresholds.
.PP
When run with the \f(CW\*(C`purge\*(C'\fR argument, \fBwallet-unknown-hosts\fR will build a
list of keytab objects the same as with the \f(CW\*(C`report\*(C'\fR argument, using the
same additional arguments, but rather than printing them out will instead
delete them from the wallet database.  To run \f(CW\*(C`purge\*(C'\fR, the environment
variable \s-1REMOTE_USER\s0 must be set to a principal that's a member of the
\&\f(CW\*(C`ADMIN\*(C'\fR \s-1ACL.\s0
.SH "BUGS"
.IX Header "BUGS"
\&\fBwallet-unknown-hosts\fR doesn't have any facility to purge from its
database all objects that are no longer in the wallet.
.PP
Having to specify an identity for purge mode is an artifact of the
Wallet::Server \s-1API\s0 and needs to be fixed by providing some way to perform
actions as a local administrator.
