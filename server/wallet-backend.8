.SH "NAME"
wallet\-backend \- Wallet server for storing and retrieving secure data
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fBwallet-backend\fR [\fB\-q\fR] \fIcommand\fR [\fIargs\fR ...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBwallet-backend\fR implements the interface between \fBremctld\fR and the
wallet system.  It is written to run under \fBremctld\fR and expects the
authenticated identity of the remote user in the \s-1REMOTE_USER\s0 environment
variable.  It uses \s-1REMOTE_HOST\s0 or \s-1REMOTE_ADDR\s0 if \s-1REMOTE_HOST\s0 isn't set for
additional trace information.  It accepts the command from \fBremctld\fR on
the command line, creates a Wallet::Server object, and calls the
appropriate methods.
.PP
This program is a fairly thin wrapper around Wallet::Server that
translates command strings into method calls and returns the results.  It
does check all arguments except for the <data> argument to the store
command and rejects any argument not matching \f(CW\*(C`^[\ew_/.\-]+\ez\*(C'\fR; in other
words, only alphanumerics, underscore (\f(CW\*(C`_\*(C'\fR), slash (\f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR), period (\f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR),
and hyphen (\f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR) are permitted in arguments.  This provides some
additional security over and above the checking already done by the rest
of the wallet code.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-\-quiet\fR, \fB\-q\fR" 4
.IX Item "--quiet, -q"
If this option is given, \fBwallet-backend\fR will not log its actions to
syslog.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.IX Header "COMMANDS"
Most commands are only available to wallet administrators (users on the
\&\f(CW\*(C`ADMIN\*(C'\fR \s-1ACL\s0).  The exceptions are \f(CW\*(C`autocreate\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`get\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`store\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`show\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`destroy\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`flag clear\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`flag set\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`getattr\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`setattr\*(C'\fR,
and \f(CW\*(C`history\*(C'\fR.  All of those commands have their own ACLs except
\&\f(CW\*(C`getattr\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`history\*(C'\fR, which use the \f(CW\*(C`show\*(C'\fR \s-1ACL\s0, and \f(CW\*(C`setattr\*(C'\fR,
which uses the \f(CW\*(C`store\*(C'\fR \s-1ACL\s0.  If the appropriate \s-1ACL\s0 is set, it alone is
checked to see if the user has access.  Otherwise, \f(CW\*(C`get\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`store\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`show\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`getattr\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`setattr\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`history\*(C'\fR access is permitted if the
user is authorized by the owner \s-1ACL\s0 of the object.  \f(CW\*(C`autocreate\*(C'\fR is
permitted if the user is listed in the default \s-1ACL\s0 for an object for that
name.
.PP
Administrators can run any command on any object or \s-1ACL\s0 except for \f(CW\*(C`get\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`store\*(C'\fR.  For \f(CW\*(C`get\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`store\*(C'\fR, they must still be authorized by
either the appropriate specific \s-1ACL\s0 or the owner \s-1ACL\s0.
.PP
If the locked flag is set on an object, no commands can be run on that
object that change data except the \f(CW\*(C`flags\*(C'\fR commands, nor can the \f(CW\*(C`get\*(C'\fR
command be used on that object.  \f(CW\*(C`show\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`history\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`getacl\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`getattr\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`owner\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`expires\*(C'\fR without an argument can still be
used on that object.
.PP
For more information on attributes, see \s-1ATTRIBUTES\s0.
.IP "acl add <id> <scheme> <identifier>" 4
.IX Item "acl add <id> <scheme> <identifier>"
Adds an entry with <scheme> and <identifier> to the \s-1ACL\s0 <id>.  <id> may be
either the name of an \s-1ACL\s0 or its numeric identifier.
.IP "acl create <name>" 4
.IX Item "acl create <name>"
Create a new, empty \s-1ACL\s0 with name <name>.  When setting an \s-1ACL\s0 on an
object with a set of entries that don't match an existing \s-1ACL\s0, first
create a new \s-1ACL\s0 with \f(CW\*(C`acl create\*(C'\fR, add the appropriate entries to it
with \f(CW\*(C`acl add\*(C'\fR, and then set the \s-1ACL\s0 on an object with the \f(CW\*(C`owner\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`setacl\*(C'\fR commands.
.IP "acl destroy <id>" 4
.IX Item "acl destroy <id>"
Destroy the \s-1ACL\s0 <id>.  This \s-1ACL\s0 must no longer be referenced by any object
or the \s-1ACL\s0 destruction will fail.  The special \s-1ACL\s0 named \f(CW\*(C`ADMIN\*(C'\fR cannot
be destroyed.
.IP "acl history <id>" 4
.IX Item "acl history <id>"
Display the history of the \s-1ACL\s0 <id>.  Each change to the \s-1ACL\s0 (not
including changes to the name of the \s-1ACL\s0) will be represented by two
lines.  The first line will have a timestamp of the change followed by a
description of the change, and the second line will give the user who made
the change and the host from which the change was made.
.IP "acl remove <id> <scheme> <identifier>" 4
.IX Item "acl remove <id> <scheme> <identifier>"
Remove the entry with <scheme> and <identifier> from the \s-1ACL\s0 <id>.  <id>
may be either the name of an \s-1ACL\s0 or its numeric identifier.  The last
entry in the special \s-1ACL\s0 \f(CW\*(C`ADMIN\*(C'\fR cannot be removed to protect against
accidental lockout, but administrators can remove themselves from the
\&\f(CW\*(C`ADMIN\*(C'\fR \s-1ACL\s0 and can leave only a non-functioning entry on the \s-1ACL\s0.  Use
caution when removing entries from the \f(CW\*(C`ADMIN\*(C'\fR \s-1ACL\s0.
.IP "acl show <id>" 4
.IX Item "acl show <id>"
Display the name, numeric \s-1ID\s0, and entries of the \s-1ACL\s0 <id>.
.IP "autocreate <type> <name>" 4
.IX Item "autocreate <type> <name>"
Create a new object of type <type> with name <name>.  The user must be
listed in the default \s-1ACL\s0 for an object with that type and name, and the
object will be created with that default \s-1ACL\s0 set as the object owner.
.IP "check <type> <name>" 4
.IX Item "check <type> <name>"
Check whether an object of type <type> and name <name> already exists.  If
it does, prints \f(CW\*(C`yes\*(C'\fR; if not, prints \f(CW\*(C`no\*(C'\fR.
.IP "create <type> <name>" 4
.IX Item "create <type> <name>"
Create a new object of type <type> with name <name>.  With some backends,
this will trigger creation of an entry in an external system as well.
The new object will have no ACLs and no owner set, so usually the
administrator will want to then set an owner with \f(CW\*(C`owner\*(C'\fR so that the
object will be usable.
.IP "destroy <type> <name>" 4
.IX Item "destroy <type> <name>"
Destroy the object identified by <type> and <name>.  With some backends,
this will trigger destruction of an object in an external system as well.
.IP "expires <type> <name> [<date> [<time>]]" 4
.IX Item "expires <type> <name> [<date> [<time>]]"
If <date> is not given, displays the current expiration of the object
identified by <type> and <name>, or \f(CW\*(C`No expiration set\*(C'\fR if none is set.
The expiration will be displayed in seconds since epoch.
.Sp
If <date> is given, sets the expiration on the object identified by <type>
and <name> to <date> and (if given) <time>.  <date> must be in the format
\&\f(CW\*(C`YYYY\-MM\-DD\*(C'\fR and <time> in the format \f(CW\*(C`HH:MM:SS\*(C'\fR.  If <date> is the
empty string, clears the expiration of the object.
.Sp
Currently, the expiration of an object is not used.
.IP "flag clear <type> <name> <flag>" 4
.IX Item "flag clear <type> <name> <flag>"
Clears the flag <flag> on the object identified by <type> and <name>.
.IP "flag set <type> <name> <flag>" 4
.IX Item "flag set <type> <name> <flag>"
Sets the flag <flag> on the object identified by <type> and <name>.
Recognized flags are \f(CW\*(C`locked\*(C'\fR, which prevents all further actions on that
object until the flag is cleared, and \f(CW\*(C`unchanging\*(C'\fR, which tells the
object backend to not generate new data on get but instead return the same
data as previously returned.  The \f(CW\*(C`unchanging\*(C'\fR flag is not meaningful for
objects that do not generate new data on the fly.
.IP "get <type> <name>" 4
.IX Item "get <type> <name>"
Prints to standard output the data associated with the object identified
by <type> and <name>.  This may trigger generation of new data and
invalidate old data for that object depending on the object type.
.IP "getacl <type> <name> <acl>" 4
.IX Item "getacl <type> <name> <acl>"
Prints the \s-1ACL\s0 <acl>, which must be one of \f(CW\*(C`get\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`store\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`show\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`destroy\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`flags\*(C'\fR, for the object identified by <type> and <name>.
Prints \f(CW\*(C`No ACL set\*(C'\fR if that \s-1ACL\s0 isn't set on that object.  Remember that
if the \f(CW\*(C`get\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`store\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`show\*(C'\fR ACLs aren't set, authorization falls
back to checking the owner \s-1ACL\s0.  See the \f(CW\*(C`owner\*(C'\fR command for displaying
or setting it.
.IP "getattr <type> <name> <attr>" 4
.IX Item "getattr <type> <name> <attr>"
Prints the object attribute <attr> for the object identified by <type> and
<name>.  Attributes are used to store backend-specific information for a
particular object type, and <attr> must be an attribute type known to the
underlying object implementation.  The attribute values, if any, are
printed one per line.  If the attribute is not set on this object, nothing
is printed.
.IP "history <type> <name>" 4
.IX Item "history <type> <name>"
Displays the history for the object identified by <type> and <name>.  This
human-readable output will have two lines for each action that changes the
object, plus for any get action.  The first line has the timestamp of the
action and the action, and the second line gives the user who performed
the action and the host from which they performed it.
.IP "owner <type> <name> [<owner>]" 4
.IX Item "owner <type> <name> [<owner>]"
If <owner> is not given, displays the current owner \s-1ACL\s0 of the object
identified by <type> and <name>, or \f(CW\*(C`No owner set\*(C'\fR if none is set.  The
result will be the name of an \s-1ACL\s0.
.Sp
If <owner> is given, sets the owner of the object identified by <type> and
<name> to <owner>.  If <owner> is the empty string, clears the owner of
the object.
.IP "setacl <type> <name> <acl> <id>" 4
.IX Item "setacl <type> <name> <acl> <id>"
Sets the \s-1ACL\s0 <acl>, which must be one of \f(CW\*(C`get\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`store\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`show\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`destroy\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`flags\*(C'\fR, to <id> on the object identified by <type> and
<name>.  If <id> is the empty string, clears that \s-1ACL\s0 on the object.
.IP "setattr <type> <name> <attr> <value> [<value> ...]" 4
.IX Item "setattr <type> <name> <attr> <value> [<value> ...]"
Sets the object attribute <attr> for the object identified by <type> and
<name>.  Attributes are used to store backend-specific information for a
particular object type, and <attr> must be an attribute type known to the
underlying object implementation.  To clear the attribute for this object,
pass in a <value> of the empty string (\f(CW\*(Aq\*(Aq\fR).
.IP "show <type> <name>" 4
.IX Item "show <type> <name>"
Displays the current object metadata for the object identified by <type>
and <name>.  This human-readable output will show the object type and
name, the owner, any specific ACLs set on the object, the expiration if
any, and the user, remote host, and time when the object was created, last
stored, and last downloaded.
.IP "store <type> <name> [<data>]" 4
.IX Item "store <type> <name> [<data>]"
Stores <data> for the object identified by <type> and <name> for later
retrieval with \f(CW\*(C`get\*(C'\fR.  Not all object types support this.  If <data> is
not given as an argument, it will be read from standard input.
.SH "ATTRIBUTES"
.IX Header "ATTRIBUTES"
Object attributes store additional properties and configuration
information for objects stored in the wallet.  They are displayed as part
of the object data with \f(CW\*(C`show\*(C'\fR, retrieved with \f(CW\*(C`getattr\*(C'\fR, and set with
\&\f(CW\*(C`setattr\*(C'\fR.
.SS "Keytab Attributes"
.IX Subsection "Keytab Attributes"
Keytab objects support the following attributes:
.IP "enctypes" 4
.IX Item "enctypes"
Restricts the generated keytab to a specific set of encryption types.  The
values of this attribute must be enctype strings recognized by Kerberos
(strings like \f(CW\*(C`aes256\-cts\-hmac\-sha1\-96\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`des\-cbc\-crc\*(C'\fR).  Note that
the salt should not be included; since the salt is irrelevant for keytab
keys, it will always be set to \f(CW\*(C`normal\*(C'\fR by the wallet.
.Sp
If this attribute is set, the specified enctype list will be passed to
ktadd when \fIget()\fR is called for that keytab.  If it is not set, the default
set in the \s-1KDC\s0 will be used.
.Sp
This attribute is ignored if the \f(CW\*(C`unchanging\*(C'\fR flag is set on a keytab.
Keytabs retrieved with \f(CW\*(C`unchanging\*(C'\fR set will contain all keys present in
the \s-1KDC\s0 for that Kerberos principal and therefore may contain different
enctypes than those requested by this attribute.
